The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.  The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions.   Here, we use the Demographics dataset and reduce its dimensionality by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Afterwards, we  find the main clusters by KMeans Clustering.
