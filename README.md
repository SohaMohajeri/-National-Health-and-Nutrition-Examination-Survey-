The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related datasets.

In this notebook, the main goal is to determine the types of diseases affecting patients. For this purpose, first we will perform data cleaning and transform the data into a uniform format. Afterwards, we will sandardize the clean data and perform dimensionality reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step prior to data segmentation. Finally, we will find the main clusters or types of the diseases by KMeans Clustering.
